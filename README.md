***Simple snake game, to be upgraded later.***

### How to play: ### 

The game is as easy as possible: your tiny newborn python snake crawls through the screen field and eats apples falling from the trees above (the trees are not visible). 
Each eaten apple makes your snake grow: it becomes bigger at 0,1 m (10 cm) per each apple.  

Your tiny python understand both standart game moving command sets: 

- use 'W' or up_arrow to **move up**
- use 'S' or down_arrow to **move down**
- use 'D' or right_arrow to **move right**
- use 'A' or left_arrow to **move left**

If the snake meets screen walls or bytes its own tail, the game stops.
When your snake is knocked down, push 'C' to **feed it again** or 'Q' to **quit** the game.
